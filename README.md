# Invoice-Total-CSharp
●	Created a C# form where user can enter sub-total and the application will calculate the discount amount, based on the sub-total, and the total price
●	By default, the discount is 10%, so it will show 10% of the sub-total (discount amount) and the deducted price after the discount
